			        <p>
			            My name is Steven and I am currently in my fourth year at the University of California San Diego. I am
			            studying Computer Engineering which is a culmination of computer hardware and software, but recently, my focus
			            is more on the software side. My favorite languages to program in are Java and the C's(C, C#, C++), but have
			            also dabbled in Python. Lately, I have been doing a lot of web development, and I absolutely love it. I hope to find myself in that field when I graduate or sometime in the near future. In addition to web developing, I have also been working on some Android projects on the side. Any new, completed projects that I have, I will post on this site. If you have any questions about my projects or want to get in touch with me, feel free to email me at stevenlim890@gmail.com or click on one of the icons on the home page.
