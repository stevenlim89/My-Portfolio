									This website is a site for users to be able to make blogs. All you need to do is signup and you will be able to create a blog in minutes. The blogs can be shared by copying the unique url on the browser and pasting into a facebook, twitter, or other social media site post. Each blog has its own page with all of the posts listed. Each post can also be viewed on its own and has its own URL that can be shared. BlogMo provides people an easy way to share ideas without all of the hassle. All you need to do is signup!

									I would have put the source code on Github but I did not want to compromise any of my users data or expose any code involving security. Instead, I will provide the link to the website.

									This program gets a link and continually goes to that link depending on the time specified. For instance, if you put 10 seconds, then it will keep "pinging" your website every 10 seconds. The purpose of the program is to keep sending requests to the site to keep it awake. If you have a free hosting site such is the case with Heroku, then they will put your site to sleep if there is no activity. With this PingBot, your site will continue to stay awake. Servers will not be able to shut your site down if there is a constant stream of requests coming in.
									<br>
									I would put an example of it on here, but I used bootstrap to make it instead of Semantic-UI. I did not want to have two frameworks on one site. Please feel free to look at the source code and copy it yourself.

									This program gets a list of pictures from within your html code and displays them one at a time.
									You can choose the interval at which they fade. Uses javascript to manipulate the photos while keeping
									them in place. Unlike other carousels (such as bootstrap), this is timed and there are no arrows that you have to press.
									Great for banners and headers, especially if you put text over the pictures. Make sure the pictures have some opacity or good
									contrast before putting text over it, however. 
									<strong style="color: #00BEBE">Note:</strong> opacity of photos was changed through photo editing outside of the site, NOT through css
									or javascript.
